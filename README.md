Certainly! Here's a tailored README template for your string matching project using the Boyer-Moore algorithm, implemented in Python and C#.

Boyer-Moore String Matching Project
Introduction
This project implements the Boyer-Moore algorithm for string matching, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness in text search. The implementation is provided in both Python and C# to showcase the algorithm's application in different programming environments.

Team Members
Elmuntserbalah Taher: Focus on Python implementation, algorithm optimization , Documentation.
David Isaac: Specialized in C# implementation, testing, algorithm optimization and documentation.

Running the Project
Python:

1- Navigate to the Python source folder: cd [Python source folder]
2- Run the script: python boyer_moore.py
C#:

1- Navigate to the C# project folder: cd [C# project folder]
2- Build and run the project: dotnet run

Input Examples
 in python: 
 


Reviewing and Evaluating the Project
Guidelines for Reviewers
Focus on the following aspects:

Algorithm Implementation: Correctness and efficiency of the Boyer-Moore algorithm.
Language-Specific Features: Effective use of Python and C# features.
Code Quality: Readability, comments, and organization.
Comparative Analysis: Comparison between Python and C# implementations in terms of performance.
Evaluation Criteria
Execution Speed: Time taken for various string and pattern lengths.
Memory Usage: Efficient use of resources.
Cross-Language Functionality: Consistency in results between Python and C# versions.



**How to Clone the Repository**
To simply clone (download) the repoistory to gain access to all the files, just open up your command terminal and run the following command:

*Note:* Be sure to run this after changing the directory of your command line "cd" to preferably your desktop path.

```
git clone https://github.com/CIS1221-2023-2024/A3-StringMatching.git
```


**Accessing the folder's contents**
Once you've cloned the folder, change your terminal's directory to the path of where the folder may be stored in.

```
cd C:/Path/To/File/A3-StringMatching
```
# Running the programs.

## CSharp Files

The CSharp file once compiled using the terminal will create an executable *.exe* file. To run the respective CSharp programs, simply enter the command on your terminal
```
CSharpProgram.exe
``` 
If you're using a built-in terminal like VSCode's Terminal, you may have to run the executables like so:
```
./CSharpProgram.exe
```
