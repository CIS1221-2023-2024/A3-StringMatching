# Creating The Boyer Moore String Matching Algorithm

For our approach, we will be creating a string matching algorithm by following the model of the **Boyer-Moore** Algorithm.
Our decision to move forward with this algorithm was justified by the efficiency of the said algorithm, contrary to other possible models such as **Brute-Force** or **KMP**.

The programming languages in question that we have implemented such algorithm are **C#** and **Python**
