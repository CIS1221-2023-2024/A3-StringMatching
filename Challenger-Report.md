# Challenger Report: String Matching Program
#### Challenger: Shania Saliba
## Brainstorming Session
Initially, the team and I planned an on-campus meeting to discuss the scope of their project as seen on this [discussion thread](https://github.com/CIS1221-2023-2024/A3-StringMatching/discussions/2). During the meeting, they informed me about what they had programmed up to that point, and explained how to run and manage their programs. They were extremely helpful in explaining how the string matching algorithms (specifically Boyer Moore – the part of their project they were mainly focusing on.) Additionally, they indicated all the difficulties they were facing and expressed their aspirations for program enhancements. 

## Evaluation and Solution Improvements

I started running the programs and conducting thorough testing, specifically in the Python programs. I identified instances where the code did not produce accurate results. I promptly informed the team about these issues, as documented in the [discussion thread](https://github.com/CIS1221-2023-2024/A3-StringMatching/discussions/18). In the discussion, one can clearly see the mistakes the code was making, visualized with the GUI I built. At this juncture, I had already planned and developed a Python GUI for the team. Upon reviewing their implementation, the team acted promptly, addressing and successfully resolving the problems I had encountered, informing me [here](https://github.com/CIS1221-2023-2024/A3-StringMatching/discussions/18#discussioncomment-8007543).

When running and trying out the C# implementation, I also encountered the same functional errors. The code would completely skip certain patterns. I informed the team about this in a [discussion](https://github.com/CIS1221-2023-2024/A3-StringMatching/discussions/21) providing screenshots consisting of the errors I was facing. In the replies, they indiciated where the mistake in the good-suffix table had been and fixed it. 

Overall, at this point the team had done a great job at implementing the Boyer Moore algorithm and subsequently, I decided that the best way that I can improve this project was to provide a GUI in python. The prior project simply outputted a ‘Found at index x’ print and was not that user-friendly and interactive. The graphical user interface gives a visually engaging and responsive look of what the functionality is doing. So, using tkinter I constructed a visual display that highlighted the parts in which the pattern in the string is found. This package allowed me to create menus, labels, input text-boxes, buttons and grid them all onto a window. The implementation can be found in the [file](https://github.com/CIS1221-2023-2024/A3-StringMatching/blob/main/ChallengerFiles/GUI.py). The script uses a sample Boyer-Moore algorithm to function. The in-line comments explain further how I used the package tkinter to construct the GUI and design everything into place. 

My last request was for the team to update the Python project with the GUI provided and see exactly how it functions. Additionally I proposed to implement a simple indicative function in C# to append brackets in place of the found pattern [(as explained here](https://github.com/CIS1221-2023-2024/A3-StringMatching/discussions/21)). Although I recognized would not be too relevant to the actual functioning of the system and I set it out to be optional suggestion. I also pointed out other minor faults that I had encountered in the functionality.

## Conclusion
Whilst reviewing the provided documentation, I can say that the team did an excellent job in explaining clearly what their project consists of, even making a video and multiple WIKIs. These gave detailed information regarding the computer resources used, time complexity, and the efficiency of their studied algorithm and also its relevance compared to other string matching algorithms. 

On the whole, the team showed great interest in their project. They gave consistent, on-time, and effective contributions. As well as, they researched the String Matching algorithms deeply and found the best methods as well as performed several checks to make sure their code is running efficiently.
